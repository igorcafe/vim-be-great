				WELCOME!

This a list of exercises for vim motions.

The idea is to teach you how to vim by practice and repetition.
These exercises don't expect you to know anything about vim at all, so I'll try
my best to explain.

You can move down with the arrow keys for now.


				HOW IT WORKS?

It's simple.
The script launches vim with the current exercise you are on. When you finish
it, you save and close vim, and it checks if the resulting file is correct.
If so you are moved to the next exercise.

If you want to go to the next exercise, press Esc, then type :wq and press
Enter.

If otherwise you just want to quit, press Esc, then type :cq! and press Enter.

NOTE: these commands will be explained later.
