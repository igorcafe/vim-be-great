# GOING TO INSERT MODE


You can enter INSERT mode in various ways, but for now you can use  i  key.
To go back to NORMAL mode, press Esc .

Exercise:

  1. Move around using hjkl (as always)

  2. Enter insert mode with  i  

  3. Insert the missing key

  4. Exit insert mode with  Esc  and go to step 1.


NOTE:
     The  ^  symbol is used to indicate you should place your cursor above it
     and enter INSERT mode.

NOTE:
     Fix it from right to left, so the  ^  always point to the right position.


FIXME:
```
---> Place the cursor hre and fix ths phras.
                       ^            ^      ^
---> Now plac it here nd fix this phrase.
             ^        ^
```


When you finish, as always, hit <Esc> :wq <Enter>.

Or you can abort pressing <Esc> :cq <Enter>.
