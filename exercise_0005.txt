			QUICKLY QUITTING VIM

You've learned how to quit vim, force quit, write quit and to just write.

Now lets learn two useful shortcuts for that:

     ZZ    Quit and save file
     ZQ    Quit without saving file


Exercise:

  1. Fill the [ ] below with a capital X

  2. Exit vim with  ZQ

  3. The script will say the answer is incorrect and reopen this file

  4. Fill the [ ] again with an  X  and go to the next lesson with  ZZ


[ ] I have finished this lesson.


NOTES:

  1. You must be in NORMAL mode (press  Esc  to make sure)

  2. The letters must be capital (holding  Shift  or enabling  Caps Lock )
