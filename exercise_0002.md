# INTRODUCTION TO MODES

Vim has multiple modes, but you will mostly use 3:

## NORMAL

The mode you are currently on.
It's used mostly for moving around and deleting or copying text.

## INSERT

Used to, well, insert text.
You use this mode when you are writing, but leave it to move
around or delete stuff.

### VISUAL

Visual mode is used to select text.
Selected text can be deleted, copied or saved to a file.
