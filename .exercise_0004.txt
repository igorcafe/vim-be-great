				QUITTING VIM

In the past exercises I told you to go to the next by using  :wq , but what does
this command do?


     You can quit a vim window* by typing the command  :q  and pressing enter.
     But it will give an error if there are unsaved changes.

     To just save a file you can use  :w . It stands for "write".

     To save and quit, use  :wq . 

     To force quit without saving changes, use  :q! .


*window: this concept will be explained later. For now just think that closing a
window is closing vim.


Exercise:

  1. Quit vim without making any changes with  :q .
     Its okay, the script will relaunch this file.

  2. Now fill the [ ] below with a capital X

  3. Exit vim without saving with  :q!
     Once again you will come back to this file.

  4. Fill the [ ] for the last time with an  X  

  5. Save and quit with  :wq  to go to the next lesson


[X] I have finished this lesson.
