			INTRODUCTION TO MODES

Vim has multiple modes, but you will mostly use 3:

     NORMAL
     The mode you are currently on.
     It's used mostly for moving around and deleting or copying text.

     INSERT
     Used to, well, insert text.
     You use this mode when you are writing, but leave it to move
     around or delete stuff.

     VISUAL
     Visual mode is used to select text.
     Selected text can be deleted, copied or saved to a file.


You can enter INSERT mode in various ways, but for now you can use  i  key.
You can go back to NORMAL mode by pressing  Esc .

Exercise: move around using hjkl (as always) and enter insert mode with  i  to
fix the following examples.

The  ^  symbol is used to indicate you should place your cursor above it and
enter INSERT mode.

NOTE: fix it from right to left, so the  ^  always point to the right position.

     Place the cursor here and fix this phrase.
                       ^            ^      ^
     Now place it here and fix this phrase.
             ^        ^

When you finish, as always, hit <Esc> :wq <Enter>.

Or you can abort pressing <Esc> :cq <Enter>.
